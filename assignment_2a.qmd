## Approach

Five of my friends and family members will be asked to rate the following six Studio Ghibli movies on a scale from 1–5:

* Howl’s Moving Castle
* Kiki’s Delivery Service
* Pom Poko
* Princess Mononoke
* Ponyo
* Spirited Away

Based on their responses, a relational database with the attributes **raterId**, **movieId**, **movieName**, and **rating** will be created. If a rater has not seen a listed movie, a rating of 0 will be recorded.

The database will then be exported to a .csv file in order to be loased into R.
